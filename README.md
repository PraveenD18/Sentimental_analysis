# Sentiment_Analysis-Tamil_English-Romanized-Text

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis utilizing various machine learning and deep learning techniques on text data. The project involves classifying text into categories such as 'Mixed feelings', 'Negative', 'Positive', and 'Unknown state'. The sentiment analysis is performed using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, as well as deep learning models like LSTM and BERT.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- **Importing Packages**: Initialization step for importing necessary Python libraries and frameworks like Transformers, Torch, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow, etc.
  
- **Datasets**: Loading and preprocessing datasets from multiple sources including training, development, and test datasets.

- **Preprocessing**: Text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and preparing the data for model training.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizing various machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis and evaluating their performance metrics.

- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing LSTM and BERT models for sentiment analysis on text data and evaluating their accuracy.
